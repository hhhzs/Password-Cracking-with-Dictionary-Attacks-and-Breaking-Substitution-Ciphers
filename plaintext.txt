i was wearing only shorts and a long sleeved t shirt. i had my miura rock shoes on my feet, and my chalk bag dangling at my back, but no harness, and not even a single carabiner. in one pocket i put a few clif kid zbars, my favorite multi pitch snack, and i filled a collapsible flask with about a third of a liter of water. i put that in my other pocket, though it pulled my shorts down a little. but i knew it would take me a few hours to climb the route, and i did not want to be parched by the time i reached the hard pitches up high. a pack was out of the question, partly because of all the chimneys in the middle of the route, but mainly because the climbing was hard enough that i did not want any extra weight on my body.
